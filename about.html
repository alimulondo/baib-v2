              <p>
                We offer nanny placements and train home skills for both nannies and house wives, with a strong emphasis on childcare and hygiene. Home skillers provides families with well-trained domestic nannies and other domestic helpers. We offer training for domestic workers in childcare, stimulation, CPR and First Aid, hygiene, cooking skills, elderly care services and Baking skills
We work with other service providers and agencies that offer services such as outsourcing nannies for clients, counselling, swimming lessons, cultural practices& ethics, driving lessons, mobile fitness training, home appliance maintenance services, interior designs, bridal shower services and we also advise parents on how to manage their staff in case they request for any assistance.
Home skillers believe that nannies should be treated in a fair and equal manner by paying them a market related salary with decent working hours.
We advise our clients accordingly when it comes to legal issues such as leave, working hours, meals, overtime and ethical issues such as bonuses, pension schemes etc.  The above issues are often grey areas that can cause discord in the working relationship. Our aim is to ensure that both the employer and nanny are happy with their working arrangement and expectation of each other.
